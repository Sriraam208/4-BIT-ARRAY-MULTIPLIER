# 4-BIT-ARRAY-MULTIPLIER
Design and Implementation of 4- bit Array multiplier circuit using Verilog HDL
STEP 1:- Initialize the Xilinx Vivado software and create new project and select the RTL project category.
STEP 2:- In add sources add the ARRAYMULTIPLIER.V file and skip the next steps by just clicking next and while selecting xilinx part or board select ZedBoard and click on finish.
STEP 3:- Click on Run implementation and according to Truth table in report assign and verify the output.
STEP 4:- Get the data given in the report and analise the data fetched.
The desired circuit for 4 - bit array multiplier using Verilog HDL is designed and implemented.
